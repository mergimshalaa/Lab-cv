                    <p>My name is Mergim Shala and I am 25 years old. I moved back 
                        to Sweden after my adventures as a professional soccerplayer 
                        came me to an end and it was a time for a career change. I am 
                        currently studying to become a Frontend Developer in Gothenburg and 
                        looking for an internship where I can use the knowledge I have acquired
                        during the education. Somewhere I can develop as a professional and 
                        get the chance to learn the the industry for real.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My other passion is to play chess at my sparetime, it makes me relax. As a person I'm driven and forward thinking. I like to work
                        independently, while I know from football experience that 
                        I'm a great team player and that working as a team is 
                        important for me. I'm easy to deal with and adaptable 
                        depending on the situation, I don't see setbacks as a 
                        dead-end but rather as an obstacle that I need to climb over.
