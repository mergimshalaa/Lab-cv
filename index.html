                    <p>My name is Mergim Shala and I am 25 years old. I moved back 
                        to Sweden after my adventures as a professional soccerplayer 
                        came me to an end and it was a time for a career change. I am 
                        currently studying to become a Frontend Developer in Gothenburg and 
                        looking for an internship where I can use the knowledge I have acquired
                        during the education. Somewhere I can develop as a professional and 
                        get the chance to learn the the industry for real.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My other passion is to play chess at my sparetime, it makes me relax. 
                        As a person I'm driven and forward thinking. I like to work
                        independently, while I know from football experience that 
                        I'm a great team player and that working as a team is 
                        important for me. I'm easy to deal with and adaptable 
                        depending on the situation, I don't see setbacks as a 
                        dead-end but rather as an obstacle that I need to climb over.

                <p>One of the projects we were given was to modernize a "less good" website with 
                    HTML & CSS where the focus was on the visuals and responsiveness from 
                    construction to finished product. The project's goal has been from 
                    the beginning that problems we encountered should be solved with 
                    communication and intentions which are one of my strengths.</p>

                <p>I have done an analysis on the user-interface on a website that we 
                    chose where the aim was to examine the five different parameters.
                    The focus of this task was to investigate the user-experience on the
                    site to work with can be improved. One design tool we used to work 
                    with was Figma to create the improvements of the site.

                    JavaScript functions and events.

            <p>In my previous work experience, I have mostly played soccer my 
                whole life. I got the opportunity to test my wings abroad as a 
                full-time professional in Albania. Otherwise I have had a few 
                part-time jobs at schools when I played in Sweden. My duty was 
                to act as a role model for these youths and to support and build 
                a community in times of difficulty. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Other tasks consisted of 
                planning, directing and leading employees when I acted as a 
                deputy manager during the summer shift. Most of my life have 
                been playing soccer which has been my job.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have always worked with other people in teams which have been on of my main strengths.
                Year 2022 was the year that I got my eyes on web development. I tried coding myself which
                I thought was fun including problem solving and decided that this is what I want to work
                with in the future.
